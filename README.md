# Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression  

This project predicts car prices based on factors like year, kilometers driven, fuel type, and company using a Linear Regression model.  

## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
- Cleaned and preprocessed car dataset  
- Handled missing and inconsistent data  
- Encoded categorical features using `OneHotEncoder`  
- Built and trained a `LinearRegression` model using `sklearn.pipeline`  
- Saved the model using `pickle`
